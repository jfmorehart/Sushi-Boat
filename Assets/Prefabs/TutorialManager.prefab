  tutorialText:
  - "Ahoy there! Seems it\u2019s your first time on me trusty old vessel, eh? Been
    seein' a fair share o' you youngins lately!"
  - "Now hold on\u2026 what've ye got there in yer hand, lad?"
  - "Humph! Well don't be gettin' yer hopes too high with all that nonsense. A bunch
    a baloney if ya ask me! Out here, there\u2019s nothin\u2019 but hungry mouths
    and some good ol\u2019 regular fish."
  - Though, if ye aim to earn a coin or two aboard this here ship, ye best know what
    to do.
  - Well looky here, seems like ye've got yer first customer! Go on and take their
    order.
  - 'Now that ye''ve taken their order, it''s time to get to work! Our sushi here
    relies on fish, rice, and sometimes a bit o'' seaweed. Let''s reel in some fish.

'
  - Ah, good catch! Now, let's get to slicin' and dicin'!
  - Now, onto the rice. Mind ye, me rice cooker's a tad wonky, so best to keep an
    eye on it.
  - Well done! Once it's cooked, ye can either stash it away in one o' them bowls
    for later or start preppin' the sushi right away! Let's get everything ready.
    Bring it all on over to this here prepping station.
  - Great Job! Now serve it to the hungry customer!
  - "That's a pleased customer if ever I've seen one! But ye best be quick about
    it, folks 'round these parts aren\u2019t known for their patience. Remember,
    the quicker ye serve, the better the tips!\r\n"
  - "But don\u2019t be pushing yerself too hard cause you can wait a bit to take
    their orders if yer feeling overwhelmed. It\u2019ll help with their patience,
    but it also means fewer tips!"
  - "Though, er, an angry customer will give you nothing\u2026 Just something to
    keep in mind."
  - Some might fancy a bit o' seaweed in their sushi, so keep an eye out for that
    and bring it to the table if needed.
  - Well done, matey! Seems ye've got the hang of it. Good luck!
