  - "Ahoy there! Been seein' a fair share of you rookies lately. Now hold on\u2026
    what've ye got there in yer hand, lad?"
  - Humph! Trying to get rich off all that meteor nonsense huh? It's cursed I tell
    you! You best be careful because people are going missing...
  - You're set on it, eh? Well, you aren't gonna last long out there without any
    money!
  - "Well looky here! Yer first customer! Let\u2019s make them some sushi."
  - It's best to aim for the healthier lookin fish and avoid the greener ones. Now,
    let's get to slicin' and dicin'!
  - Good job! Now, customers will prefer that the rice isn't undercooked or burnt,
    though you can serve whatever ya have if you're short on time.
  - Well done! Let's bring everything on over to this here prepping station when
    you're ready.
  - That's a pleased customer if I've ever seen one! Remember, the quicker ye serve,
    the more people will show up!
  - <color=red>REMEMBER</color> keep an eye out if a customer wants seaweed and bring
    it to the table if needed.
  - Finally, not all sushi is created equal! To make the most money, you gotta be
    both quick AND careful with your preparation!
  - 'That''s about it! Well done, matey! Do be careful around that meteor though,
    I''ve been seeing some VERY strange stuff out there and the fish ain''t right...
    Good luck. You''re gonna need it. '
